This is the tmux config I use

---
Install tmux beforehand

```bash
sudo apt-install tmux
```

or 

```bash
brew install tmux
```

To use homebrew, download it [here](https://brew.sh/)

---
use 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CrowHugin/tmux-config ~/
```

or 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CrowHugin/tmux-config ~/config/tmux/
```

---
Go inside your file and use `Control Space + I (in capital)` 

---
Now you can use it

*enjoy :)*
